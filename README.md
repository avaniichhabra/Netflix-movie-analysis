# Netflix Movie Data Analysis 

This is my first beginner-friendly data analysis project using Python. I cleaned, explored, and visualized Netflix movie data using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

##  Dataset
I used a dataset called `mymoviedb.csv`, which contains information about 9,800+ movies such as:
- Title
- Release Date
- Genres
- Popularity
- Vote Average & Vote Count

##  What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the data
- Converted release dates to year
- Categorized vote averages
- Separated and exploded genres
- Created visualizations using Seaborn
##  Visual Insights
- Most frequent genre: **Drama**
- Highest rated movie (popularity): **Spider-Man: No Way Home**
- Most movies were released in **2020 & 2021**
- Popular vote average distribution across genres

##  What I Learned
- How to clean and prepare a real dataset
- How to visualize trends using Python
- How to structure a project for GitHub

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
